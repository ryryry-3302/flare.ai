**1. Content (Ideas and Development)**

| Score | Descriptor |
|---|---|
| **Beginning (1)** | - **Topic is merely *named* or hinted at, with absolutely no development whatsoever.** The writing is *vanishingly* short, essentially devoid of substance, and may consist of only a title or fragment. <br> - **Ideas are absent or, if present, are completely isolated and random, showing no attempt at connection or central idea.**  There are *no* discernible details provided; writing is purely generic or non-existent. <br> - **Demonstrates *utterly no* discernible focus.** The writing is a random collection of words or phrases, or completely off-topic, if a topic can even be identified. <br> **Example:** *A title only, like "Summer," or a single, unrelated word.  Or,  "Ball. Tree. Water."* |
| **Emerging (2)** | - **Presents a *hint* of a topic, but development is *extremely minimal and superficial*.** Ideas are often presented as a *simple list* or *isolated statements* with little to no connection. <br> - **Ideas are *severely underdeveloped*, *highly repetitive*, and *completely generic*.** Supporting details are *virtually absent* or entirely lacking. <br> - **Focus is *tenuous and easily lost*.** The writing *frequently drifts* or *barely touches* the topic. <br> - ***Extremely limited* exploration of the topic; ideas are surface-level and predictable.**  <br> **Example:** *"My dog. Hot day.  I like food."* -  Related to general experiences, but just disconnected phrases, barely ideas. |
| **Proficient (3)** | - **Focuses on a central topic and presents a *few* basic ideas.**  Development is *minimal but present*, often relying on listing or simple repetition. <br> - **Ideas are *loosely connected* to the topic, but connections are basic and predictable.**  Transitions between ideas are weak or formulaic (e.g., "and then," "also"). <br> - **Provides *minimal* details and examples to support ideas, and these are often general and lack specificity.**  <br> - **Main idea is *somewhat* identifiable, but may not be consistently maintained throughout the writing.** <br> **Example:** *"My dog is nice. He plays with toys. He eats food. He sleeps a lot."* -  Simple statements about a dog, but still list-like and basic with minimal development. |
| **Experienced (4)** | - **Clearly focuses on a central topic and develops ideas with relevant details and examples.**  Ideas are expanded upon with some depth. <br> - **Demonstrates good control of the topic, with ideas logically connected and building upon each other.**  Transitions are present and help guide the reader. <br> - **Ideas are purposeful and contribute to the overall message or story.** Details enhance the reader's understanding and engagement. <br> - **Main idea is clear and consistently maintained.**  <br> **Example:** *"My dog, Buster, is incredibly playful.  When I throw a tennis ball, he leaps into the air to catch it. He's so fast he can outrun me across the park, his ears flapping in the wind.  Sometimes when he's excited, he'll bark a loud, happy bark that makes me laugh."* - More specific details and connections between ideas. |
| **Exceptional (5)** | - **Clearly and consistently focuses on a central topic and develops ideas with rich, specific, and insightful details.** Ideas are explored in depth and demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic. <br> - **Skillfully demonstrates outstanding control and sophisticated development of ideas.** Ideas are intricately connected and build upon each other in a compelling way. <br> - **Offers purposeful, creative, and original details and examples that enhance the writing.**  Foreshadowing, if used, effectively enhances the central theme. <br> - **Main idea is compelling, consistently maintained, and explored with nuance and complexity.** <br> **Example:** *"My dog, Buster, is the embodiment of playfulness.  His energy is boundless; even a simple walk turns into an acrobatic display as he bounds through the grass, chasing phantom squirrels.  When he sees a tennis ball, his eyes gleam with focused joy, and he transforms into a furry missile, leaping and twisting to make the catch.  His bark, far from being annoying, is a joyous announcement, a booming laugh that echoes his uncontainable happiness, instantly infectious and guaranteed to bring a smile to anyone nearby."* - Vivid, insightful, and complex development of the idea of "playfulness." |

Sunny day.  Home time."* -  Hints at a sequence, but order is illogical and disjointed, like random notes. |
| **Proficient (3)** | - **Organizes events or details, often using a simple chronological structure (telling events in time order).** The structure is functional but may feel predictable or formulaic, like a simple list of events. <br> - **Includes a basic opening that introduces the topic and a closing that provides a minimal sense of completion.** These elements may be simple and undeveloped. <br> - **Relies on basic and sometimes repetitive transitions** (e.g., "then," "next," "so") to connect ideas. <br> - **Structure is present but may feel mechanical or predictable.** <br> **Example:** *"First, I got ready to go to the park. Then, my mom drove me. Next, we arrived and I saw dogs.  Finally, we went home."* - Clearer chronology but still very basic. |
| **Experienced (4)** | - **Presents a clear and logical organization that effectively develops the central idea.**  The structure enhances the reader's understanding and follows a recognizable pattern (e.g., chronological, cause/effect, problem/solution). <br> - **Includes a clear opening that sets up the topic and a closing that provides a sense of resolution or summary.** These elements contribute to the unity of the piece. <br> - **Uses transitions effectively to connect events and ideas smoothly.** Transitions guide the reader through the writing. <br> - **Details and events are arranged purposefully to create a cohesive whole.**  <br> **Example:** *"To get to the dog park, we first had to gather our things: leash, water, and a ball.  The drive felt long because I was so excited.  When we arrived, the sound of barking and happy yelps filled the air.  After an hour of playing, we were all tired but happy to head home."* -  More purposeful structure with cause/effect elements (excitement making the drive feel long). |
| **Exceptional (5)** | - **Presents a sophisticated and purposeful organization that skillfully drives the writing forward.** The structure is seamless and enhances the overall impact and meaning. <br> - **Includes a compelling opening that grabs the reader's attention and effectively introduces the central idea.**  The closing provides a satisfying sense of closure and may reinforce the main idea in a memorable way. <br> - **Utilizes varied and effective transitions to create a smooth and engaging flow.** Transitions are not just functional but also contribute to the style and tone of the writing. <br> - **Structure is thoughtfully crafted and contributes significantly to the overall effectiveness and artistry of the piece.**  The organization may be creative or unexpected in a way that enhances the writing. <br> **Example:** *"The anticipation started before we even left the house.  Gathering the leash and ball was like preparing for an adventure.  The car ride, usually mundane, stretched out, each minute an eternity in my eagerness.  Then, we arrived, and it was like stepping into a different world.  A cacophony of joyful barks erupted, a symphony of canine glee.  Sunlight dappled through the trees, illuminating dogs of every shape and size chasing, wrestling, and simply being gloriously, unapologetically dog.  Leaving was bittersweet, a gentle return to quiet, but the memory of that vibrant dog world lingered, a warm echo in the silence."* -  Structure builds anticipation and uses sensory details to create a vivid experience. |
